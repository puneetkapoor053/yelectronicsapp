# YElectronics Android

The Android repository for the YElectronics mobile application.

# Developer Requirements

* [Android Studio 4.0.x](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

If a newer version of Android Studio is available (i.e. 4.2 or higher), make sure the team has migrated to that version before using it.

## First Time Setup

1. Clone or download a copy of the repository
2. Setup Android Studio and the current targeted SDK.
3. In AS, open an existing project and choose the directory for this project.
4. AS should open, index, and attempt to sync with the `gradle` build scripts. It may take a few minutes to download all dependencies.
5. Once completed, run the project for an emulator or a device.

To setup an emulator, follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).
